# Pop&Spark in the Sky
### "Pop all the balls before time runs out to win!"
The game allows a player to shoot bullets from a red arrow to pop bouncing balls. An attached green paddle above the shooter helps keep the balls in play by bouncing them back. When a ball is popped, it creates a colorful firework-like effect, adding a dynamic and visual element to the gameplay.
