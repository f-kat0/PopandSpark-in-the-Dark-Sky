# Pop&Spark in the Dark Sky Game
### "Pop all the balls before time runs out to win!"
The game allows a player to shoot bullets from a red arrow to pop bouncing balls. An attached green paddle above the shooter helps keep the balls in play by bouncing them back. When a ball is popped, it creates a colorful firework-like effect, adding a dynamic and visual element to the gameplay.

# Project design and implementation
This game was developed based on a baseline code pattern with a bouncing ball and a paddle. I added a shooter and a firework effect for making it more fun and enjoyable.
To ensure the game works properly, I tested it by changing the number of balls and the time limit to see how it performs with different settings. However, there's still a bug where the balls sometimes get stuck on the sides of the walls.

Since there are still a lot of things I wanted to add to make it more effective and interesting but couldn't make it in time.
